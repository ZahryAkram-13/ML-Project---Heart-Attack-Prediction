Heart Attack Prediction
Problem Description

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early prediction of heart attacks can help save lives by enabling timely medical intervention. This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of a heart attack based on various patient health metrics.

Objective

The primary goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can analyze patient data and estimate the risk of a heart attack. The model aims to assist healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk individuals and making informed decisions.
Data

The dataset used for this project contains patient health records with attributes such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, heart rate, and other relevant features. Each record is labeled with whether the patient experienced a heart attack (1) or not (0). The data is preprocessed to handle missing values and normalize features for better model performance.
